First attempt at full-blown web application facilitated by 'Programming on The Internet' course at UNO.

This project marked the beginning of my web-dev education and demonstrates the skills I learned during 
the class. These include: Perl (intermediate to advanced knowledge), CSS (relative beginner but working
on it), and HTML (beginner to intermediate level, and working on that as well).
